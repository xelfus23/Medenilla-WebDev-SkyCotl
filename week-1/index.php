    <p>Let's dive into some PHP fundamentals</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Syntax: PHP code is embedded within HTML using &lt;?php .... ?&gt; tags. </li>
        <li>Comments: Use // for single-line comments and /* ... */ for multi-line comments.</li>
        <li>Case Sensitivity: PHP is case-sensitive; variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
        <li>Variables: Declare variables using the $ symbol (e.g., $beeCount).</li>
        <li>Echo/Print: Use echo or print to display content on the page.</li>
        <li>Data Types: PHP supports various data types, including strings, numbers, and arrays.</li>
        <li>String Concatenation: Combine strings with the . operator (e.g., $greeting . ' from PHP!').</li>
